            <p>This extension flags suspicous material on puppy adoption sites that suggest the seller may be a puppy mill.</p>
            <p>We hope this will help adopters make informed decisions on dog adoption sites.</p>
            <p>DISCLAIMER: The flags are merely suggestions of unusual activity! Clean sellers could be flagged, puppy mills could go unflagged. Flags are merely meant to signal that an extra level of caution should be used when buying the dog.</p>
